# portfolio
My personal web portfolio, a space where I bring together my projects and a way to get in touch. Crafted with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have chosen to stick to the basics, avoiding libraries and tools to keep things sleek and straightforward. The site is intuitively organized into key sections.

This is currently version 1 of my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my projects. I am continuously working on new ideas to enhance this space.
